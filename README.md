## Here's my journey! Read it all if you want I guess.. I am just killing time here😁:

- It all started when I was **9**. The age I made my first Roblox Account. Yes, Roblox.. What does that have to do with anything? Well you see, I used to play so much games back and I always used to wonder. How are these games made?
- Started making my own games at 10. They weren't big, just an obby that had like 20 players in it's lifetime :) But that "Experience" that I made(iykyk) opened my eyes to.. You guessed it! MORE GAMES. A-And coding. Started with **LUA** which is the language that Players in Roblox use to make games.
- I was dedicated... For 5 minutes because "Parent" and "Children" objects made my head dizzy. So, at **Age 11**, I started learning Python. Python was simple, and did not make me as dizzy as Lua did(Probably because I finally gained the brain cells to understand that I had to cover the basics first).
- Had a big break and started to learn to make websites at my Mid-13s. Participated in an Exhibition at my School! Made 2 websites, one is a **Horoscope Finder** and the other was a **Speech to Text Converter** which I would've shared with you all IF my laptop hadn't broke down.🙄
- Then, I travelled to another school for a Codex Competition, Me and my 2 Teammates(Both 12th Grade) Made 2 Android Applications. One was **WalletHub**, the other was **FitnessTracker**. The Codex however, did not go THAT great but hey, we all start somewhere right? Also, did I mention I was the only 9th Grader to get selected for Codex? All my opponents were 11th and 12th Graders! So, I guess a big W for me.
- After that, I participated in World CyberSecurity Day! Made my own Virus which I will share with everyone here! My audience were filled with 11th and 12th graders, And yeah, Thats my whole journey to date. Made a lot of projects on the way in which I will share with you all :D
- 10th was a flop lmfao.. I wasn't able to go to any events but I was able to use that time to learn a lot about **AI**, **Linux** and **Cybersecurity**. 2026 my year fr 💯💯
